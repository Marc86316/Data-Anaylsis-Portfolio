## 📦 Course Chapters

### 1. Using Iterators in PythonLand
Learn all about iterators and iterables, which you have already worked with when writing for loops. You'll discover useful functions that allow you to work with iterators more effectively. This chapter ends with a case study using Twitter data, showcasing how to work with large datasets in chunks using iterators.

#### 🔹 Introduction to Iterators
- Iterators vs. Iterables  
- Iterating over iterables (1)  
- Iterating over iterables (2)  
- Iterators as function arguments  

#### 🔹 Playing with Iterators
- Using `enumerate`  
- Using `zip`  
- Using `*` and `zip` to 'unzip'  

#### 🔹 Using Iterators to Load Large Files into Memory
- Processing large amounts of Twitter data  
- Extracting information from large amounts of Twitter data

### 2. List Comprehensions and Generators
Build on your knowledge of iterators by mastering list comprehensions and generator expressions. These tools will help you write elegant and memory-efficient code for both small and large datasets.

#### 🔹 List Comprehensions
- Write a basic list comprehension  
- List comprehension over iterables  
- Writing list comprehensions  
- Nested list comprehensions  

#### 🔹 Advanced Comprehensions
- Using conditionals in comprehensions (1)  
- Using conditionals in comprehensions (2)  
- Dict comprehensions  

#### 🔹 Introduction to Generator Expressions
- List comprehensions vs. generators  
- Write your own generator expressions  
- Changing the output in generator expressions  
- Build a generator  

#### 🔹 Wrapping Up Comprehensions and Generators
- List comprehensions for time-stamped data  
- Conditional list comprehensions for time-stamped data

### 3. Bringing it All Together!
Apply your skills to a case study using data from the **World Bank's World Development Indicators**. You'll combine techniques learned throughout the course to build practical solutions for handling large, real-world datasets.

#### 🔹 Welcome to the Case Study!
- Zipping dictionaries  
- Writing a function to help you  
- Using a list comprehension  
- Turning this all into a DataFrame  

#### 🔹 Using Python Generators for Streaming Data
- Processing data in chunks (1)  
- Writing a generator to load data in chunks (2)  
- Writing a generator to load data in chunks (3)  

#### 🔹 Using pandas' `read_csv()` Iterator for Streaming Data
- Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (1)  
- Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (2)  
- Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (3)  
- Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (4)  
- Writing an iterator to load data in chunks (5)  

#### 🔹 Final Thoughts
